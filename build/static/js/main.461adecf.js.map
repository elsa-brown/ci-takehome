walk through an AST using a depth first traversal, calling\n\t * the visitor's enter function at each node in the traversal, and calling the\n\t * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n\t *\n\t * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n\t * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n\t * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n\t * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n\t *\n\t * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n\t * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n\t * visit function.\n\t *\n\t *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n\t *
